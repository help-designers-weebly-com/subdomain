	      <p>communicate with each other.Function:Hubs work at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. 
They broadcast all data packets they receive to every device connected to them, regardless of the 
intended destination. This means if a hub has 5 devices connected, and one device sends data, all 5 
devices will receive it. Only the intended recipient will process the data, while the others will discard 
it.Ports:Hubs usually have multiple Ethernet ports to connect various devices (computers, printers, 
etc.).Performance:Hubs are inefficient because they do not filter or direct data; they simply flood the 
network, causing a lot of unnecessary traffic and potential collisions.Key Characteristics:Broadcasts 
data to all connected devices.Does not filter or manage traffic.Operates at Layer 1 of the OSI 
model.Prone to network collisions in larger networks. Use:Hubs are mostly outdated and have been 
replaced by switches, which offer better performance and efficiency.
